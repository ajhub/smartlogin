   So go ahead, place your login mechanism or watever you know it as ,in <loginmech.php>. You'l be briefed more about it in the file itself.
   
5. Almost done. We said it was easy.
   Place the library in your websites root directory. Place SmartLogin icon on your login page, and direct it to www.yourwebsite.com/smartloginlibrary/qrlogin.php
